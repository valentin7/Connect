Connect
---------------------------

Connect is an iOS app that facilitates quick networking with the people around you. It is designed with first encounters at conventions, business meetings, hackathons, or similar gatherings in mind.

The app displays a list of users on the same Wi-Fi network, complete with a picture and a list of interests for each user. Need to find graphic designer at a hackathon, or cardiologist at a medical conference? Connect makes it easy.
